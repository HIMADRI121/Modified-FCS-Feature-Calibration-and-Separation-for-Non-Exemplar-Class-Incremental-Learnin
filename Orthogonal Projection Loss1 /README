This fole contain the followimg tasks:
1.  Replace the Prototype-Involved Contrastive Loss with Orthogonal
Projection Loss1 and compare the model performance across all datasets.
2. Perform experiments without incorporating Prototype-Involved Contrastive Loss (PIC) and evaluate the accuracy on the CIFAR-100
